TerrainFinder is an application created to reverse engineer coordinates in Minecraft based on naturally generated terrain in a Minecraft world.
It can be used to find coordinates of someone's area/base if you look at naturally generated terrain in a screenshot or video.

program usage data to be sent to the creator.
